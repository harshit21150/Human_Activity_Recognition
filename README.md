This repo contains dataset and various model trained code files for identifying around 15 different human activities using various multimedia formats

Video Frame Encoder File : This File Contains the video conversion raw code to switch video feed input into sampled images to enhance a faster output feed rate. Sampling frequency and Data Visualization rate can be modified according to the needs.


Har-eda file : this file contains the complete script of the  Exploratory Data Analysis done on the training dataset, to report the model train requirments for feature engineering to train the model. 

svm-tester file : it has the complete training and testing script. with option to save the trained SVM and PCA model. Note: Both SVM and PCA Model are correlated and synchronous to each other, testing reuire both .pkl files
